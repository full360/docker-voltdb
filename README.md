# VoltDB Community Edition Docker Image

This repo contains the files to generate a VoltDB Community Edition Docker image
by downloading and compiling the source inside at build time.

Makefile will extract all required files from the VoltDB repo with compiled
files. Those files will be used for building the Docker image.
