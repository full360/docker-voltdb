# VoltDB Community Edition Docker Image

This repo contains the files to generate a VoltDB Docker image from an already
compiled Linux VoltDB Community Edition version.

Makefile will extract all required files from the VoltDB repo with compiled
files. Those files will be used for building the Docker image.
